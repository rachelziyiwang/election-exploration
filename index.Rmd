This data comes from [this repo](https://github.com/alex/nyt-2020-election-scraper) and shows the candidate leads over time. Interestingly, Biden took the lead in Georgia at `r biden_lead_georgia_time`.

Here is the number of timestamps for each state in the dataset:
```{r}
library(knitr)
kable(timestamps_by_state, col.names = c("State", "Number of Timestamps"))
```

Here is what the result looked like at the end of the vote tallies:
``` {r}
vote_diff_plot
```
